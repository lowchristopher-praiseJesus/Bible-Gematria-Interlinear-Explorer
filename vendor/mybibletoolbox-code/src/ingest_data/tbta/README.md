# TBTA (The Bible Translator's Assistant) Processor

Processes TBTA database export files into structured YAML commentary files for the myBibleToolbox project.

## Overview

TBTA is a rules-based Bible translation assistance tool that encodes detailed cross-linguistic features to help translators working in languages with grammatical categories that differ from English. This processor extracts TBTA data from JSON export files and converts it to our YAML format.

## Data Source

- **Source**: [AllTheWord/tbta_db_export](https://github.com/AllTheWord/tbta_db_export)
- **License**: Check repository for licensing details
- **Format**: JSON export from TBTA databases

## Prerequisites

The TBTA processor scripts will automatically clone the TBTA database export to `/tmp/tbta_db_export` when needed. No manual setup required!

## Tools

### 1. extract_feature.py - Extract Feature Values for STAGES.md Step 4

Extracts all verses for a specific TBTA feature field, used in feature development workflow (STAGES.md Step 4).

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Extract Person system (includes clusivity)
python src/ingest-data/tbta/extract_feature.py --field Person

# Extract with custom limit and output file
python src/ingest-data/tbta/extract_feature.py \
  --field "Participant Tracking" \
  --max-per-value 500 \
  --output data.yaml

# Dry run to see statistics only
python src/ingest-data/tbta/extract_feature.py --field Mood --dry-run
```

**Options:**
- `--field` (required): TBTA field name (e.g., "Person", "Mood", "Participant Tracking")
- `--max-per-value` (default: 2000): Cap verses per value (LRU cache)
- `--output`: Output file path (default: stdout)
- `--dry-run`: Show statistics without writing output

**Output Format:**
Generates simplified YAML for LLM processing (STAGES.md Step 4 format):
```yaml
feature: person
extracted: '2025-11-15T17:47:50Z'
tbta_commit: 07797f2
max_per_value: 2000
value:
  - specific_value: First Inclusive
    total_verses: 1386
    distribution:
      OT: 979
      NT: 407
      Books: {GEN: 123, EXO: 89, ...}
    verses:
      - GEN.001.026
      - GEN.003.022
      # ... (up to max_per_value)
```

**Common TBTA Field Names:**
- `Person` - Person system (includes First Inclusive, First Exclusive)
- `Number` - Number system (Singular, Dual, Trial, Paucal, Plural)
- `Participant Tracking` - Discourse participant tracking
- `Mood` - Verb mood (Indicative, Imperative, etc.)
- `Aspect` - Verb aspect
- `Proximity` - Demonstrative proximity
- `Discourse Genre` - Text genre classification
- See [TBTA-FEATURES.md](../../bible-study-tools/tbta/tbta-source/TBTA-FEATURES.md) for complete list

**Auto-cloning:** The script automatically clones/updates TBTA data from GitHub to `/tmp/tbta_db_export`

### 2. tbta_processor.py - Process Specific Verses

```bash
# Single verse
python src/ingest-data/tbta/tbta_processor.py --verse "GEN 1:1"

# Single chapter
python src/ingest-data/tbta/tbta_processor.py --chapter "GEN 1"

# Entire book
python src/ingest-data/tbta/tbta_processor.py --book GEN

# All verses (entire Bible)
python src/ingest-data/tbta/tbta_processor.py --all
```

### Test Without Writing Files

```bash
# Dry run on Genesis 1
python src/ingest-data/tbta/tbta_processor.py --chapter "GEN 1" --dry-run
```

## Output Format

Generated files follow this structure:

```
./bible/commentaries/{BOOK}/{CHAPTER}/{VERSE}/{BOOK}-{CHAPTER}-{VERSE}-tbta.yaml
```

**Examples:**
- `./bible/commentaries/GEN/001/001/GEN-001-001-tbta.yaml`
- `./bible/commentaries/MAT/005/003/MAT-005-003-tbta.yaml`

## Output Structure

```yaml

```

## Key TBTA Features

### 1. Number Systems
Beyond singular/plural:
- **Singular**: One item
- **Dual**: Exactly 2
- **Trial**: Exactly 3 (e.g., Trinity in Gen 1:26)
- **Quadrial**: Exactly 4
- **Paucal**: A few
- **Plural**: Many

### 2. Person Systems
Beyond 1st/2nd/3rd:
- **First Inclusive**: "we" including listener
- **First Exclusive**: "we" excluding listener
- **First as Third**, **Second as Third**, etc.

### 3. Participant Tracking
Tracks entity flow through discourse:
- **First Mention**: Newly introduced
- **Routine**: Established participant
- **Exiting**: Leaving narrative
- **Restaging**: Reintroduced after absence
- **Frame Inferable**: Can be inferred from context

### 4. Proximity Systems
Demonstrative distinctions:
- **Near Speaker/Listener**
- **Remote within Sight / out of Sight**
- **Temporally Near / Remote**
- **Contextually Near**

### 5. Time Granularity
20+ temporal distinctions:
- Immediate Past
- Earlier Today
- Yesterday
- 2-7 Days Ago
- Weeks/Months/Years Ago
- Historic Past / Eternity Past

### 6. Speaker Demographics
- Speaker's Age (Young Adult, Middle Aged, Old, etc.)
- Speaker-Listener Age Relationship
- Speech Style (Formal, Informal, etc.)
- Speaker's Attitude

## Use Cases

### For Translation Into Languages With:

1. **Number systems beyond singular/plural** (Polynesian, Austronesian languages)
   - Example: Kilivila has dual, trial, quadrial

2. **Inclusive/exclusive distinction** (Tagalog, Malay, Fijian, many others)
   - Example: Tagalog "tayo" (inclusive) vs "kami" (exclusive)

3. **Switch-reference marking** (Native American, Papua New Guinea languages)
   - Tracks which participant is subject/object across clauses

4. **Complex demonstrative systems** (Japanese, Korean, Spanish)
   - Japanese: これ (near me) / それ (near you) / あれ (far)

5. **Temporal distance marking** (Tagalog, many others)
   - Different verb forms for immediate vs remote past

6. **Social register/honorifics** (Japanese, Korean, Javanese)
   - Age and relationship determine required verb forms

## Data Quality & Filtering

TBTA data is **manually created** and has been filtered for usability:

### What We Filter Out
- **Nullish values**: "Not Applicable", "Unspecified"
- **Empty placeholders**: "." (just a dot by itself)
- **Empty strings**: Trimmed empty values

### What We Preserve (All Meaningful Data)
- **Boolean values**: "No" (e.g., "Implicit: No" vs field absent)
- **Structural markers**: "Space" and "Period" (show rendering structure not in original Greek)
- **Semantic markers**: "Not in a Sequence", "First Coordinate", etc.
- **Discourse features**: Speaker, Listener, Illocutionary Force
- **Cross-linguistic features**: Trial number, First Inclusive person, etc.
- **Participant tracking**: Routine, Generic, Frame Inferable

This filtering reduces file size by ~27% (filtering only true nullish values) while preserving all meaningful data.

## Comparison with Macula

TBTA and Macula are **complementary but structurally different**:

| Feature | Macula | TBTA |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Focus** | Source text linguistics | Cross-linguistic translation |
| **Structure** | Word-level (flat list) | Clause-level (hierarchical tree) |
| **Strength** | Morphology, syntax, semantics | Translation edge cases, discourse |
| **Data** | Strong's, Louw-Nida, SDBH | Number/person systems, participant tracking |
| **Question** | "What does Greek/Hebrew say?" | "How to render in language X?" |
| **Granularity** | Per word | Per clause |

### Can They Be Merged?

**Not at word level** - they have fundamentally different structures:
- Macula: `words: [{position: 1, text: "οὖν", lemma: "οὖν", ...}]`
- TBTA: `clauses: [{children: [{Constituent: "God", Part: "Noun", ...}]}]`

**Yes at verse level** - a verse file could have both:
```yaml
verse: GEN.001.026
words: [...]     # From macula (word-by-word)
clauses: [...]   # From TBTA (clause-by-clause)
```

**Use both together** for comprehensive AI-grounded translation support.

## Performance

- **Single verse**: < 1 second
- **Genesis 1** (31 verses): < 1 second
- **Entire book**: Seconds to minutes
- **Full Bible**: Several minutes

## Data Source Quality

TBTA data is **manually created** by linguistic experts:
- ✅ High quality semantic/pragmatic annotation
- ✅ Carefully analyzed discourse structure
- ⚠️ May contain some errors (human-created)
- ⚠️ Not all linguistic features coded in all verses
- ✅ Filtered to remove ~27% true nullish data (preserves all meaningful values including "No", Space, Period)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyYAML: `pip install pyyaml`
- TBTA export repository cloned to `/tmp/tbta_db_export`

## Example: Genesis 1:26 - Trinity as Trial Number

```yaml
verse: GEN.001.026  # SCHEMA.md compliant format
clauses:
  - children:
      - Constituent: God
        Number: Trial           # Exactly 3 persons!
        Person: First Inclusive # "us" includes Trinity members
        # ... God speaking as 3 persons in unity
```

This explicitly encodes the **Trial number** (3 persons) which is critical for translating into languages that distinguish dual/trial/plural.
